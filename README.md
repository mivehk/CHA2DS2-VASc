# CHA2DS2-VASc Scoring System

American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) suggested a scoring system, CHA2DS2-VASc as a potential predictor of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation(Afib), and recommended long-term oral anticoagulant for non-valvular Afib patients with moderate to high CHA2DS2-VASc scores (Male >=2 and Female >=3).

## **Introduction**

More than 50 substances that affect blood coagulation have been found in human blood and tissues. Some promote coagulation, called procoagulants, and others inhibit coagulation, called anticoagulants. In the bloodstream, anticoagulants normally predominate. When the vessel is ruptured or blood is immobile for a long time, then procoagulants become activated and override. Vitamin K is required for the activation of coagulation proteins produced by the liver, such as fibrin (factor-I), thrombin (factor-II) and factor-X (Stuart-Prower factor)(Hall & Hall, 2020).

*C* represents the risk factor of  Congestive Heart Failure with 1 point
*H* represents the risk factor of Hypertension with 1 point
*A2* represents the risk factor of Age >= 75 with 2 points
*D* represents the risk factor of Diabetes with 1 point
*S2* represents the risk factor of past history of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) with 1 point  
*V* represents the risk factor of Vascular Disease with 1 point
*A* represents the risk factor of age >= 65 with 1 point
*Sc* represents the risk factor of Sex at Birth with 1 point


Here is a poster for diagnostic tools and treatment/prevention techniques commonly used for Afib with an emphasis on epidemiological distribution and determinants:
